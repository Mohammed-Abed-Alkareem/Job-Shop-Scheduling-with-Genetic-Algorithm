# Job Shop Scheduling with Genetic Algorithm

## Overview

This project aims to develop a system for job shop scheduling using a genetic algorithm. The system takes as input a list of jobs and the number of available machines, optimizing the sequence and timing of each job to minimize overall production time or maximize throughput while considering machine capacities and job dependencies.

## Requirements

- Implement a system for job shop scheduling using genetic algorithm.
- Input:
  - List of jobs with their operation sequences.
  - Number of available machines.
- Output:
  - Schedule for each machine depicting the start and end time for each process and the job it belongs to.
